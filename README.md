Capstone for IWA Section of Course

For this project, we were required to create a functional version of the Book Connect App that was given to us and not working properly. 
A mix of Javascript, CSS and Html was required for this project, however for the functional part only Javascript was really needed to get it to work. 
My app functions as it should.
